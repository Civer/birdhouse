#Synopsis

This project provides a small CMS for creating menus for your next party. Your party members (customers) can then use your webapp to order the items you provided. The administrators will be informed about the new order via push alert (by pusher.com) if wanted.

#Motivation

The idea of the project lies in 2015/16 when I hosted a lot of partys where I served cocktails as well. The guests arrived and wanted to know which cocktails I would offer. Normally I would tell them "Everything if I've the ingredients" but that was a bad idea as I learned over time. Another problem that occured was keeping track of all the orders. So I decided to write a small app which should provide a party menu for the guests and a order management tool for the host.

#Installation

The project has an included install.php which will automatically run when a DB connection fails. Run the install script (pusher data can be invalid if you don't have a pusher app) and you are good to go.

Attention: We are in BETA phase right now, so there could be missing information in config and DB files!
